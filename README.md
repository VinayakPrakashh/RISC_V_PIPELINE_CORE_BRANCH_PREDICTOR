## 📌 About the Project
This project implements a **5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU** based on the **RV32I instruction set**, featuring a **branch predictor** to enhance performance. The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1️⃣ **Instruction Fetch (IF):** Fetches the instruction from memory.  
2️⃣ **Instruction Decode (ID):** Decodes the instruction and reads registers.  
3️⃣ **Execute (EX):** Performs arithmetic or logic operations.  
4️⃣ **Memory Access (MEM):** Reads from or writes to memory (if needed).  
5️⃣ **Write Back (WB):** Writes the result back to the register file.  

🚀 **Key Features:**  
✅ **5-stage pipelining** for improved instruction throughput.  
✅ **Branch prediction** to reduce stalls and improve performance.  
✅ **Hazard handling** for data and control dependencies.  
✅ **Optimized forwarding logic** to minimize stalls.  
✅ **Vivado testbench & waveform simulation** for verification.  

This CPU efficiently executes **RISC-V RV32I instructions**, making it a **high-performance single-cycle processor with enhanced pipelining and prediction mechanisms**.


## 🧠 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
The CPU supports **all major RV32I instruction formats**:

| Type  | Format          | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **R-Type** | `rd, rs1, rs2` | Register-to-register operations |
| **I-Type** | `rd, rs1, imm` | Immediate operations & loads |
| **S-Type** | `rs1, rs2, imm` | Store instructions |
| **B-Type** | `rs1, rs2, label` | Branch instructions |
| **U-Type** | `rd, imm` | Upper immediate instructions |
| **J-Type** | `rd, label` | Jump instructions |

## 🧪 Simulation Results

This project was simulated using **Vivado 2023.1**. We verified both the functional correctness and performance improvement brought by the 2-bit branch predictor.

### 📌 Sample Assembly Code

The following RISC-V assembly loop was used to test the branch predictor mechanism:

### 🔍 Without Branch Prediction

In the absence of a branch predictor, every `BEQ` instruction causes a pipeline flush due to misprediction. As a result:

- The CPU stalls frequently.
- Final output is obtained at **325 ns**.

### 🚀 With 2-bit Branch Predictor

A 2-bit saturating counter with 4 states was implemented to improve branch prediction accuracy. With this, the CPU:

- Avoids pipeline flushing for predicted branches.
- Saves **60 ns** (3 cycles × 10 ns for each of the 2 correct predictions).
- Final output obtained at **265 ns**.

### 📊 Observations

| Metric                       | Without Predictor | With Predictor |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Branch Delay Penalty        | High              | Low            |
| Pipeline Flushes            | Frequent          | Minimal        |
| Final Execution Time        | 325 ns            | 265 ns         |
| Clock Period                | 10 ns             | 10 ns          |
| BEQ Instructions            | 2                 | 2              |
| Time Saved                  | 60 ns             | ✅             |

> ✅ The two-bit predictor enhances the CPU's performance by reducing the number of pipeline flushes during branch execution, thereby saving significant clock cycles.

### ✅ Conclusion

The simulation confirms that incorporating a **2-bit branch predictor** in a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU significantly improves performance, especially in branch-intensive programs.
