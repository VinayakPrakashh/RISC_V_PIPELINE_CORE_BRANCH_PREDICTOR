## 📌 About the Project
This project implements a **5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU** based on the **RV32I instruction set**, featuring a **branch predictor** to enhance performance. The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1️⃣ **Instruction Fetch (IF):** Fetches the instruction from memory.  
2️⃣ **Instruction Decode (ID):** Decodes the instruction and reads registers.  
3️⃣ **Execute (EX):** Performs arithmetic or logic operations.  
4️⃣ **Memory Access (MEM):** Reads from or writes to memory (if needed).  
5️⃣ **Write Back (WB):** Writes the result back to the register file.  

🚀 **Key Features:**  
✅ **5-stage pipelining** for improved instruction throughput.  
✅ **Branch prediction** to reduce stalls and improve performance.  
✅ **Hazard handling** for data and control dependencies.  
✅ **Optimized forwarding logic** to minimize stalls.  
✅ **Vivado testbench & waveform simulation** for verification.  

This CPU efficiently executes **RISC-V RV32I instructions**, making it a **high-performance single-cycle processor with enhanced pipelining and prediction mechanisms**.


## 🧠 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
The CPU supports **all major RV32I instruction formats**:

| Type  | Format          | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **R-Type** | `rd, rs1, rs2` | Register-to-register operations |
| **I-Type** | `rd, rs1, imm` | Immediate operations & loads |
| **S-Type** | `rs1, rs2, imm` | Store instructions |
| **B-Type** | `rs1, rs2, label` | Branch instructions |
| **U-Type** | `rd, imm` | Upper immediate instructions |
| **J-Type** | `rd, label` | Jump instructions |
